# TODO: Fix ESLint Errors in Home.jsx

- [ ] Move mockFeaturedProperties outside the Home component to make it stable
- [ ] Add import for SearchBar component from '../../components/common/Header/SearchBar'
- [ ] Verify useCallback dependencies (should be [] after moving mockFeaturedProperties outside)
- [ ] Test compilation to ensure errors are resolved
